Austin Willis
Password keeper project

The program can be run with 'php pwkeep.php'.

The first time you run the application you will be prompted to create
a new password. When you confirm your password a file will be create at
'.pwkeep/<yourusername>.txt. The password you entered is hashed and stored
in this file. If a file exists in that location when the application runs
it will prompt you for your password and compare its hash to the string in
that file.

Once logged in, you will be prompted to enter an option. The 'h' option
will display all of the available options.

The application can be terminated by entering the 'q' option.

Entering 'a' will prompt you to add the information for a new site. You
can only add one record for each site.

You can use the 'r' option to replace a site record with a new one.

Entering 'd' will prompt you for the url of a site whose record you would
like to delete.

Entering 'o' will prompt you for a url and then search for a record for
that url. If none is found it will alert you that it did not exist.

Entering 'l' will display all of the records that have been entered.

Enter 's' will prompt you to enter a string and then search all of the
records for that string. A list will be displayed of all records that
contained the string you searched for.

Entering 'e' will prompt you for a filename to export the data to. All of
the records will have their information written to that file.

Files in the format created with the export command can be imported with
the 'i' command. Any records that match those in the imported file will be
replaced by the ones in the file.
